The scope of private modifier is limited to the class only.

    1. Private Data members and methods are only accessible within the class
    2. Class and Interface cannot be declared as private
    3. If a class has private constructor then you cannot create the object of that class from outside of the class.

This example below throws compilation error because we are trying to access the private data member and method of class ABC in the class Example. The private data member and method are only accessible within the class.

class ABC{  
   private double num = 100;
   private int square(int a){
	return a*a;
   }
} 

public class Example{
   public static void main(String args[]){  
	ABC obj = new ABC();  
	System.out.println(obj.num); 
	System.out.println(obj.square(10));
   }  
}

Result:

Compile - time error
