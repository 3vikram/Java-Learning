1. Hashcode is not same as address of an object 

2. Hashcode methods can be overriden based on our requirement, Where as address of an object cannot be overridden as it's impossible to do so

3. To find the address of an object or size of an object it's impossible using Java

4. Hashcode is nothing but a unique code generated by the JVM for an Object

5. Hashcodes are used by JVM during data storage and access using HashMap or Hashtable or HashSet or LinkedHashMap

6. Using Hashcodes search operations will be fast (O(1))

Linear search = One by one element search with O(n)

Binary search = Taking mid or average search point with O(log2 n)
